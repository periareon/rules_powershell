# rules_powershell

Bazel rules for [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/).

`rules_powershell` is a set of Bazel rules that bring the same functionality as
[`rules_shell`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_shell), but designed for
PowerShell. These rules make it possible to write and run build actions,
tests, and entrypoints in PowerShell while integrating cleanly with Bazelâ€™s
sandboxing, toolchains, and reproducibility guarantees.

The goal is feature parity with `rules_shell`, so you can use PowerShell
scripts as first-class citizens in your Bazel builds without special casing.
